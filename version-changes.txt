v1.1.1-alpha
  # Fixes
    -> Updated 'If', 'For' and 'While' from 'Expressions' to 'Statements'

    -> Fixed 'Args List' Parsing: parsing compound assignment operations is now available
  # Features
    -> Single Line 'If', 'For' and 'While' Statements are now implemented

    -> Negative Numbers: -10, -1.5
    
    -> Added 'length' Built-In Function: length(10), length("string"), length([1, true, "three"]), (string, number, object, list)

    -> Function can now be 'Anonymous': fn(x) {body}
    -> Variable Assignment, Variable Declaration and Function Call can now support 'Statements': let a = fn(args) { body }; function(fn(args) {body});
  
    -> 'foreach' statement
    -> Identifier Computed Object Access: obj[ident] // ident of type "string"
    
v1.2.1-alpha
  # Changes
    -> For statement compound assignment can now be a numeric expression or a numeric variabile which will increase the cycle variabile by its value: for(let i =0 ; i < 5; 1) // 1 is the same as i += 1, for(let i = 0; i < 5; a) // a is the same as i += a
    -> Assignment expression now support 'assignee' (Expression) instead of 'name' (string) 
  # Features
    -> Better error implementation: ParserError, InterpreterError, line and column indication.
    -> Added compound increment operator: i++, i--
    
v1.2.2-alpha
  # Fixes
    -> Lexer MAJOR error fixed: the lexer wasn't skipping "skippable" characters, such as " " (Space), "\t" (Tab), ecc, properly 


v1.2.3-alpha
  # Fixes
    -> Fixed foreach and while statements: now foreach and while statements skip new line tokens properly.
    -> Fixed for statement: now for statement variable declaration works properly.
  # Features
    -> Added input built-in function: input(text) // input supports numbers, booleans ans strings 

v2.0.0
  # Features
    -> Added logical operations: a == b || 2 == 3 || 3 == 2


v2.0.1
  # Changes
    -> Single line comment now uses '#' instead of '//'
  # Features
    -> Added integer division: 8 // 3 # 2

== ^^ RELEASED ^^ ==

v2.1.0
  # Features
    -> Built-In, Default and User-Made libraries: // Built-In libraries are already implemented in the code, Default's have to be imported

          -> sqrt(num)
          -> pow(base, exponent)
          -> rand(min, max, decimals), 
          -> PI
        -> Math: // Default
