v-1.1.1-alpha
  # Fixes
    -> Updated 'If', 'For' and 'While' from 'Expressions' to 'Statements'
    -> Fixed 'For Loop' variabile declaration: declaring a 'Counter' variabile ( e.g. for(let i = 0; ...) ) inside the parenthesis now doesn't throw an error
    -> Fixed 'Args List' Parsing: parsing compound assignment operations is now available
  # Features
    -> Single Line 'If', 'For' and 'While' Statements are now implemented

v-1.2.0-alpha
  # Features
    -> Lists
      -> Added List Declaration: list = [value, ...]
      -> Added List Print: print(list), print(list[idx])
      -> Added List Return Value: list[idx]
      -> Added List Value Assignment: list[idx] = value
      -> Added List Concatenation: list_c = list_a + list_b
      -> Added List Functions
        -> push(list, value)
        -> pop(list)
        -> shift(list)
        -> unshift(list, value)
        -> slice(list, start, end?)
        -> contains(list, value)
        -> reverse(list, value)
        -> filter(list, function)
        -> map(list, function)
        -> sort(list, inverted?)

    -> Negative Numbers: -10, -1.5
    
    -> Added 'length' Built-In Function: length(10), length("string"), length([1, true, "three"]), (string, number, object, list)

    -> Function can now be 'Anonymous': fn(x) {body}
    -> Variable Assignment, Variable Declaration and Function Call can now support 'Statements': let a = fn(args) { body }; function(fn(args) {body});
  
    -> 'foreach' statement
    -> Identifier Computed Object Access: obj[ident] // ident of type "string"
    
v-1.2.1-alpha
  # Changes
    -> For statement compound assignment can now be a numeric expression or a numeric variabile which will increase the cycle variabile by its value: for(let i =0 ; i < 5; 1) // 1 is the same as i += 1, for(let i = 0; i < 5; a) // a is the same as i += a
    -> Assignment expression now support 'assignee' (Expression) instead of 'name' (string) 
  # Features
    -> Better error implementation: ParserError, InterpreterError, line and column indication.
    -> Added compound increment operator: i++, i--
